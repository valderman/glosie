Possibly the first web application ever completely written in Haskell; train
your hiragana prowess by letting this simple application serve you with
questions to answer and keep track of what you get wrong - or add your own
dictionaries to the dicts subdirectory and train something else.

The main point of this rewrite is to test the reactive standard library of
http://ekblad.cc/haste. Turns out, it's crap and will be completely rewritten.
